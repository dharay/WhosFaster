This repo contains various frameworks for backend which support the following 2 endpoints:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/fib/35  (...fib/Int)

http://127.0.0.1:8000/  (hello world)

The fib endpoint calculates and returns the nth term of fibonacci series and all have the same algo for calculation: 
eg: In python

```python
def calulateFib(n):
    if n==0 or n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return calulateFib(n-1)+calulateFib(n-2) 
```

Load testing parameters: 
    siege creates multiple (100) threads and keeps on calling a specific endpoint on that thread for some (5 sec) time.
    Transactions - succesfull number of hits
    Availibility - % of successful hits
